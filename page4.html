            <h1>Why Donate?</h1>
            <p>Blood is essential to human life.</p>
            <p>Every two seconds, a person in the US will need a blood transfusion. .</p>
            <p>Blood cannot be synthetically replicated or produced, so there is no substitute. It is also perishable, with a unit of blood lasting only 42 days (and only 5 days for platelets). Because of this brief shelf life, there is a constant need for new volunteer donors. .</p>
            <p>Volunteers may donate:
	            <ul>
		            <li>Whole blood - This is the quickest, easiest, and most common type of donation</li>
		            <li>Platelets - Blood cell fragments that help stop or prevent bleeding</li>
		            <li>Plasma - The liquid portion of your blood that transports water and nutrients to body tissues</li>
		            <li>Double Red Blood Cells - Red blood cells only</li>
	            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Although most of the US population is eligible to donate blood, only 3% of people do so on a regular basis. .</p>
            <p>Sharing your blood, even if only once per year, may help patients of all ages, including heart surgery patients, trauma victims, and those battling cancer. .</p>
            <p>In essence, blood saves lives.</p>
